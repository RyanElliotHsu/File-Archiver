# File-Archiver
Operating Systems Assignment #4
In this assignment, our purpose is to create an archiving application which performs two services:
(1) flattening a logical hierarchy(-ies) of a file system and store this hierarchy(-ies) in a single file,
and (2) recreate a file directory using the single file created.
Details regarding how the application is structured, design choices, how to use the application, etc., can
be found in the project documentation (located in the project file).
